Proposal to Add the IEC 60417-5009 Symbol to Unicode
====================================================

[Joe Loughry](mailto:joe.loughry@stx.ox.ac.uk), originally 1st December 2013.

The IEC 60417-5009 &ldquo;Stand-by&rdquo; Symbol
------------------------------------------------

On 1 December 2013, [Terence Eden](http://shkspr.mobi/blog/) posed a question to
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6828102) asking why Unicode lacks
the international symbol that appears on power buttons. After searching for a while,
I learnt he was right &mdash; in fact, Unicode lacks all the following
(the first two symbols have been re-drawn to avoid any possibility of copyright
infringement; the latter two are public-domain images from Wikipedia).

<table>
<tr>
<td>![IEC 60417-5007 "ON" (power)][IEC5007]</td>
<td>![IEC 60417-5008 "OFF" (power)][IEC5008]</td>
<td>![IEC 60417-5009 "Stand-by" (power)][IEC5009]</td>
<td>![IEC 60417-5010 "ON"/"OFF" (power)][IEC5010]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IEC 60417-5007</td>
<td>IEC 60417-5008</td>
<td>IEC 60417-5009</td>
<td>IEC 60417-5010</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&ldquo;ON&rdquo; (power)</td>
<td>&ldquo;OFF&rdquo; (power)</td>
<td>&ldquo;Stand-by&rdquo;</td>
<td>&ldquo;ON&rdquo;/&ldquo;OFF&rdquo; (push-push)</td>
</tr>
</table>

Clearly these symbols would be useful to anybody writing technical or user manuals.

Procedure for Adding Symbols to Unicode
---------------------------------------

[The Unicode Consortium](http://www.unicode.org/) has a procedure for
[submitting character proposals](http://www.unicode.org/pending/proposals.html). None of
the above symbols appear in the [pipeline](http://www.unicode.org/pending/proposals.html)
of proposed new symbols, so **let's do it!**

Getting Access to the &ldquo;Official&rdquo; Symbols
----------------------------------------

[IEC](http://www.iec.ch/) charges
[400 Swiss Francs](http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/029221)
(currently $440 USD) for the standard. If anyone has access to IEC standards through their
employer or school and wants to help, could you look at the relevant pages in
[IEC 60417](http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/ArtNum_PK/29221?OpenDocument) and
get the GIF and vectorised PDF drawings of all four symbols and also look at the copyright
information on the standard to make sure we're OK with including them in a proposal to the
Unicode Consortium?

Writing the Proposal
--------------------

TBD
