\begin{abstract}
The international symbol IEC 60417-5009 \IEC{P} meaning `power' is not in
Unicode. Clearly it would be useful to anyone writing technical or user
manuals. Furthermore, for electronically published documentation, it is
crucial for this and a few other symbols to be defined because it makes them
searchable in plain text. In this proposal we provide a TrueType font named
`IECsymbol' containing the glyphs as specified in three international standards
together with the needed character properties for Unicode specification
as well as evidence that these characters have been used in running text
for thirty years.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The \IEC{P}, \IEC{T}, \IEC{0}, and \IEC{1} symbols are defined in
IEC 60417 \cite{IEC60417}, which is also ISO 7000:2012 \cite{ISO7000}.
IEEE 1621 defines \IEC{S} and refines the definition of \IEC{P}, notably
by saying:

\begin{quote}
IEC 60417 defines \IEC{P} for use with a power switch that does not do a total
mains disconnect, and hence the device consumes standby power. \IEC{P} is
generally used and understood to mean ``power,'' as on power buttons, indicators,
and elsewhere. \IEC{P}, therefore, means ``power'' with a nonzero power level
in the \emph{off} state. Electronic devices shall use \IEC{P} to be a synonym
for ``power'' on power controls.
\end{quote}

\noindent \cite[\S 4.3, emphasis in original]{IEEE1621}. IEEE 1621 standardises
current practice for devices with regard to the \IEC{P} symbol and introduces
\IEC{S} for sleep \cite{Nordman2003,Nordman2002a}.

These characters, particularly \IEC{P}, are needed for technical writing and
are not in Unicode. The advantage of having them there would be that for the
first time they would be searchable in plain text, something not possible with
embedded graphics, which is the way the symbols have been displayed to date.

\section{Suitability for Inclusion}

These symbols are \emph{characters} according to the definition in the Glossary,
and do not appear in the Archive of Notices of Non-Approval. They are neither
in the Pipeline Table nor in BETA. They are all widely used on equipment and in
documentation (Figures \ref{figure:example-of-use-Agilent}--\ref{figure:example-of-use-Ugolini}).
It would benefit technical writers and readers if they were available in Unicode
because it would make user manuals and other technical documentation searchable
in plain text.

We provide along with our proposal a TrueType font, with no restrictions on its use.

\section{Evidence of Use in Running Text}

Figures \ref{figure:example-of-use-Agilent}--\ref{figure:example-of-use-Ugolini}
show evidence of the use of each of these symbols in running text during the past
thirty years.

\section{Character Properties}

Suggested character properties for the proposed symbols are given in Tables
\ref{table:character-properties-P}--\ref{table:character-properties-T}. These
are the same names as in IEEE 1621-2004. None of the proposed names appear
already in the Character Name Index.

\subsection{Collation Order}\label{section:collation-order}

There is no required collation order, although there is an implied state transition
ordering:

\begin{quote}
Power states shall be understood to have physical relationships to each other.
Specifically, \emph{on} is taken to be above \emph{sleep}, and \emph{sleep} above
\emph{off}.
\end{quote}

\noindent \cite[\S 4.4, emphasis in original]{IEEE1621}. We suggest \IEC{P},
\IEC{0}, \IEC{S}, \IEC{1}, \IEC{T}. They exhibit no shaping
behaviour and have no particular required sorting order (except see the quoted
paragraph above). The characters are uncased. There is no special line-breaking
behaviour required. These characters are not meant for use in identifiers,
although they have been used for such.\footnote{This web site has a collection
of more than thirty examples of IEC 60417-5009 used in logo design:
\URL{http://www.logodesignlove.com/logos-using-the-standby-symbol}.} They are
stand-alone symbols.  They are not white-space characters and have no numeric
values. They are neither combining characters nor punctuation.

\section{The \emph{IECsymbol} TrueType Font}

The five symbols included in the \emph{IECsymbol} TrueType font are shown in
Table~\ref{table:symbols}. Only these symbols exist in the font; if an undefined
character, for example `A' is called for in the font, the result is
implementation-defined.\footnote{In \hologo{XeTeX}, for example, the result of
`A' in \emph{IECsymbol} is \IEC{A}.  In OpenOffice Writer, the result is the
letter `A' but in a san-serif typeface.}

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{clcll}
		\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Applicable} & \textbf{Character} & \
			\textbf{Mnemonic} & \textbf{Meaning} \\
		& \textbf{Standard(s)} & \textbf{To Type} \\
		\hline \\
		\IEC{P} & IEC 60417-5009 & P & `power'       & Power  \\
		\IEC{0} & IEC 60417-5008 & 0 & `binary zero' & Off    \\
		\IEC{S} & IEEE 1621      & S & `sleep'       & Sleep  \\
		\IEC{1} & IEC 60417-5007 & 1 & `binary one'  & On     \\
		\IEC{T} & IEC 60417-5010 & T & `toggle'      & On/Off \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{All of the available glyphs in the \emph{IECsymbol} TrueType font.}
    \label{table:symbols} % label must come after caption!
\end{table}

Placement of symbols in the \emph{IECsymbol} TrueType font was chosen
thoughtfully so as to be mnemonic: `P' for power, `S' for sleep,
`T' for toggling power on or off, and `1' and `0' for power-on and power-off,
respectively; these mnemonics `fail gracefully' in text should the
\emph{IECsymbol} font happen to be unavailable.

In text with normal spacing, the \IEC{P} characters \IEC{0} look \IEC{S}
like \IEC{1} this \IEC{T}.\footnote{The spacing around \IEC{1} in the font appears
wider because the glyphs are fixed-width.}

\section{Anticipated Objections}

It might be argued that the meaning of \IEC{P} is disputed between IEC 60417
and IEEE 1621, {\it i.e.}, that IEC 60417 (as well as ISO 7000:2012) defined \IEC{P}
to mean `stand-by' and IEEE 1621 changed it to mean `power'. We counter that
the issue is irrelevant to the Unicode Consortium for two reasons: firstly,
because the symbol itself is needed by writers, regardless of the fact that
`stand-by' has no consistent definition;\footnote{The term is routinely used to
mean \emph{off}, \emph{sleep}, \emph{on}, and other meanings that do not map
to a consistent power state at all.} and secondly, because IEEE 1621 specifically
codifies existing practice; the number of devices using \IEC{P} to mean
`power' dwarfs the number of devices that use it to mean `stand-by'. Furthermore,

\begin{quote}
No safety issue is introduced by the use of the symbol on a switch that causes
the device to go to a \emph{hard-off} state.
\end{quote}

\noindent \cite[\S 4.3, emphasis in original]{IEEE1621}.

There are, of course, many characters in Unicode already resembling circles
(\IEC{0}), or lines (\IEC{1}), or the crescent moon (\IEC{S}). None of the existing
characters, however, has anything semantically to do with the concepts of `power',
`switch', `toggle', or `interrupter'. There are several occurrences of the crescent
moon, but none showing the \IEC{S} phase; IEEE 1621 intended the symbol to be different
from other Unicode instances of a crescent moon. There are eleven occurrences of the word
`power' in Version 6.3.0 of the Unicode standard (Table \ref{table:power}) but none
has anything to do with device control \cite{Unicode2013}.

\section{Drawing the Symbols}

The proposed characters are not part of any script and the precise form of
their drawing is not critical. As IEEE 1621-2004 says:

\begin{quote}
In accordance with IEC 80416-3, symbols can be filled, be rotated, have their lines
thickened, or be used on digital displays, as long as an ordinary user can recognize
the symbol correctly.
\end{quote}

\noindent \cite[\S 4.3]{IEEE1621}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Severability}

Of all the characters in Table \ref{table:symbols}, the most needed is \IEC{P}.
We included the others in this proposal because they form a logical group. If,
however, there is any objection to inclusion of \IEC{1}, \IEC{0}, \IEC{T}, or
\IEC{S}, the one we most need is \IEC{P}.

\section{Summary and Conclusion}

The \IEC{P}, \IEC{0}, \IEC{S}, \IEC{1}, and \IEC{T} symbols are needed by
technical writers to produce manuals in which these important symbols are
searchable in plain text. Because they were invented by the standards body
to be distinctive, new, and unambiguous, there is no confusion with existing
scripts. They have been in use in running text for at least thirty years.
The suggested character properties are simple. We provide along with this
proposal a TrueType font called \emph{IECsymbol} containing the new symbols;
the TrueType font is made available with no restrictions.
